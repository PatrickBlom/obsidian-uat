11:30 create github repo 
11:45 push .obsidian to github.com / configure git credential manager
12:00 create folder structure for all obsidian settings
12:00 download folder notes & waypoint community plugins

proceed by creating separate notes for all options and then commiting a waypoint / fn structure. 


https://www.perplexity.ai/search/i-want-to-try-and-test-functio-qjmuxLi.Qf6mL9ZmQT_vCw according to perplexity it was easier to create a repo on github.com and clone to dev system.

I chose a public repo because they are unlimited and as this is just a test environment i am not planning to store any sensitive data in it. Therefor I do not mind it being publicly accesible.

I am using https and git credential manager to sync between local state & github. git credential manager is available through homebrew. It was easy; just download the package, push to remote and i got a prompt that i had to accept in browser. when i did it pushed.

i  have created a test branch for the project so I can keep main clean. This way I can always clone main to another machine (eg. humai windows) while still working on development in the other branch. once the changes are final i can push them into main.

I'm currently thinking of a system to store my settings and why i choose them. This is why I created the folder structure. Perhaps I can organize them in files / kanban?  I want to be able to search through options that I have figured out, options that I do not fully understand (and need to research) and options that I still have to take a look at.

the most important thing is that I keep logging stuff. I want to be able to historically read back why I made certain choices. 

IDs / Sorting. I want to use an UNIX structure for anything as a default. 

I don't want to create awfully long IDs though. I will just experiment with numbers for now. Unless I see a requirement to change that that should mean that every folder file starts with 00 / 01 etc.  In projects I could see myself branching off into a/b/c etc. 

1415: create options under general

I did things by hand. It does seem a bit tedious. perhaps I can take this as a test case. Can I design an object, let's call it an Obsidian setting. The metadeta for these are: Parent, Category (General -> App -> Option ). Can I automatically create a structure this way?  This could be a POC for something like an inboxNote or a Task.
